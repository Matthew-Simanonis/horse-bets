# Horse-bets

This app is a simple in-browser horse race scoring app.

The user selects the past perforance for the past 4-races, whether it has the same jockey that day, and adds a 'jockey', 'trainer' and 'additional' scores. This is done for each individual horse.

When the user submits the selections, the app calculates and displays the scores of the top horses in a results column. 

Scores are added based on a horses past performance. 1 point for 3rd, 2 points for 2nd, 3 points for 1st.
'jockey', 'trainer' and 'additional' scores are added as a is, but can be skipped entirely.

This app is hosted with Flask, while using Javascript in the browser to calculate scores, and manipulate HTML. 

This was created to mostly practice with javascript and single page web apps. As well as a way to help my dad speed up his betting system. Try it out
